I think that the enqueue method was the only intentional bug
  implemented in this Queue class.

  I came to this conclusion because the test that I ran indicated that
    Enqueue would add the integer to the queue, however it would be inserted
    at the front of the queue and not the back, essentially creating a data
    structure that more resembled a stack than a Queue

  The test that made this clear for me specifically was testEnqueueFront and
    testDequeueBack because they both showed that the newly added integers were
    appearing at the front of the queue and not the back as they were supposed
    to
